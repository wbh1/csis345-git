It was the summer of 1928 and I was six that year.
We were at the farm on the end of the road, if you could
call it a road.  The "road" was just two tire tracks on a clay dike.
The family consisted of my mother, father, three brothers, and
myself.

The farm was on the edge of a river.  It looked like 
a good summer, I was barefoot and had two pair of coveralls.
One thing that made it seem good was that I could use 
the rowboat.  But, before I was allowed to, I had to swim the river
with my clothes on.  My father had a lot of rules and he said
if you got into the water and tried to take your pants off,
you might drown.  The river, at that point, was 1180 feet wide.

It was important to be able to go across the river, because
the only stones for my slingshot were on the railroad track on
the other side.  At six years old my only weapon was my slingshot.
One had to have a pocket full of suitable stones, as one
could never be sure when he had to defend himself from a
blackbird.  Also, it worked well to drive the horses into
and out of the cattails.  We didn't have a cow yet.

In front of the house we had a floating dock that went out into about
seven feet of water.  Back then, the water was clear enough so one
could see fish on the bottom of the river.  Because it was a floating
dock, fish loved to hide in the shade under it.  One could always
catch a meal of fish with a worm and a hook.  It took 30, nine
inch or larger fish for a meal.  At 6, I could catch the fish,
but mother cleaned them.
